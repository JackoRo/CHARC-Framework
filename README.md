# CHARC-Framework
MATLAB source code for the CHAracterisation of Reservoir Computers (CHARC) framework

See wiki for more information.

*Make sure files are on the MATLAB path when using the framework.

# Branch - Version_2
Added new flexibility to use framework with different substrates including:
- Reservoir of Reservoirs (RoR) architecture
- "Deep" reservoirs
- Ensemble reservoirs
- Graph-based reservoirs

Can also evolve each substrate directly to a task (EvolveToTask folder).
