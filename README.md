# CHARC-Framework
MATLAB source code for the CHAracterisation of Reservoir Computers (CHARC) framework used in paper.

See wiki for detailed more information and Tutorials.

Recently added new reservoirs:
- Reservoir of Reservoirs (RoR) architecture
- "Deep"/pipeline reservoirs
- Ensemble reservoirs
- Extreme Learning Machines (including multi-layer)
- Graph-based reservoirs (including some ensembles)
- Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction reservoir
- DNA (network of coupled deoxyribozyme oscillators) reservoir
- Boolean network reservoir 
- Cellular Automata (implemented with RBN) both 1- and 2-dimensional


All these work with:
- CHARC Framework
- Evolve reservoir directly to task
- Multi-objective(task) evolution using NSGA-II

Extra tasks added:
- Pole balancing: inverted pendulum, doube-pole inverted pendulum, swinging pendulum
- Autoencoder
- n-bit adders
