# CHARC-Framework
MATLAB source code for the CHAracterisation of Reservoir Computers (CHARC) framework used in paper.

See wiki for detailed more information.

*Make sure files are on the MATLAB path when using the framework.

# Version 2 (branch)
Added new reservoirs:
- Reservoir of Reservoirs (RoR) architecture
- "Deep"/pipeline reservoirs
- Ensemble reservoirs
- Graph-based reservoirs (including some ensembles)
- Belousovâ€“Zhabotinsky reaction reservoir
- DNA (network of coupled deoxyribozyme oscillators) reservoir
- Boolean network reservoir (Cellular Automata can be implemented with RBN)

All these work with:
- CHARC Framework
- Evolve directly to task
- Multi-objective(task) evolution using NSGA-II

Extra tasks added:
- Pole balancing: inverted pendulum, doube-pole inverted pendulum, swinging pendulum
- Autoencoder
